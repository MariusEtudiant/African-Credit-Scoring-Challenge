# Loan Default Prediction Challenge

## 🌟 Challenge Overview
### [CHALLENGE](https://zindi.africa/competitions/african-credit-scoring-challenge)

Financial institutions need to predict **loan defaults** to mitigate risk and optimise lending decisions. In Africa’s rapidly growing financial markets, characterised by diverse customer demographics and dynamic economic conditions, accurately assessing default risk has never been more critical.

### 🏆 Challenge Objectives
The goal of this challenge was to:
1. **Develop a robust, generalisable machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of loan defaults for both existing customers and new applicants.
2. Innovate by incorporating unique factors relevant to financial markets in Africa.
3. Propose a scalable **credit scoring function** that bins model outputs into risk categories and generates a practical credit risk score.

### 💡 Why It Matters
Accurate loan default predictions enable financial institutions to:
- Improve decision-making processes.
- Reduce financial losses associated with high-risk lending.
- Expand confidently into new financial markets.

The challenge was provided by a **private asset manager** operating in several financial markets across Africa, aiming to enhance credit risk evaluation and lending strategies.
