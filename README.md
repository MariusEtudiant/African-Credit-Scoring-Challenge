# Loan Default Prediction Challenge

## 🌟 Overview
This project was part of the [African Credit Scoring Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/african-credit-scoring-challenge), aiming to predict **loan defaults** in Africa’s dynamic financial markets. The objective was to build a robust **machine learning model** and a **scalable credit scoring function** to assist financial institutions in mitigating risk and optimising lending decisions.

## 📊 My Contribution
### Key Achievements:
- **F1-score**: Achieved a competitive score of **0.71** early in the competition.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTEENN** for hybrid resampling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporated demographic and economic factors specific to African markets.
- **Model Optimisation**: Fine-tuned **XGBoost** for robustness and generalisability.
- **Credit Scoring**: Developed a scalable function to classify probabilities into actionable risk categories.
